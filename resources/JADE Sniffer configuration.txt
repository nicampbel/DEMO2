A file can be added to your Eclipse project folder that specifies which agents should be included in the JADE Sniffer at startup.

Create a text file in notepad that lists the names of the agents you want to see in the Sniffer.
E.g.
df
Farm1Agent
Sensor1Agent
TractorAgent

Save the text file with the name "sniffer". After saving, copy the file and change the extention to ".inf".
Ultimately, there should be a "sniffer.inf" in the Eclipse project folder.
